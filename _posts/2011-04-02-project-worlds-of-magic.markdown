description: Worlds of Magic was one of Wastelands Interactive flagship titles. It's 4X turn-based strategy game, that takes place in procedurally generated worlds, divided to up to 7 planes of existence. I was responsible for external launcher, which was written in C++, Qt Framework, and for sound and animation in Unity. I've also created an deployment pipeline for Steamworks, to allow us automatically deploy new versions of the game, for every platform to Steam.
